    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* As there were more transactions in the transaction table compared to the cab-data table, it was susptected that the data in the transaction table could have been from a source considering other cab companies, and therefore, the data that was not related to the Yellow or Pink Cab companies were disregarded.\n",
    "* The outliers identified in the Price Charged variable were kept in the dataset and were also used during the data analaysis as it was assumed that the Price Charged could have been higher, depending on many circumstances that we may not have the information to further investigate, and therefore, they were not treated for this analysis.\n",
    "* The profit was calculated based on the difference between the price charged and the cost of the trip.\n",
    "* Weekends were assumed to be Friday, Saturday and Sunday in any analysis involving the weekdays and weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 359392 registers of rides in the cab_data for two companies (Yellow Cab and Pink Cab) related to the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n",
    "* The Yellow Cab (274,681) had about 3 times more rides compared to the Pink Cab (84,711) for the assessed years\n",
    "* The mean age of customers was 35 years old, with most of customers being between 18 and 40 years old. Moreover, the mean income was about USD 15,000.00 per month. Most of customers presented an income lower than USD 25,000.00 per month.\n",
    "* Most of customers had only one transaction, meaning only one ride, however there were many customers with higher number of rides. The customer with the highest number of rides in the 3-year period evaluated was 54 rides.\n",
    "* The cities Washington DC, Boston MA, Los Angeles CA, Chicago IL and San Diego CA were the cities with the highest proportion of cab users considering all 19 cities assessed.\n",
    "* The top 5 cities with higher number of rides for Yellow Cab: New York NY, Chicago IL, Washington DC, Los Angeles CA, Boston MA. The top 5 cities with higher profits included exactly the same cities that presented higher number of rides. These top 5 cities accounted for about 85% of the total profit of this company, considering the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n",
    "* The top 5 cities with higher number of rides for Pink Cab: Los Angeles CA, New York NY, San Diego CA, Chicago IL, Boston MA. However, the most profitable ones included the same list with exception to Boston MA, which was replaced by the region of Silicon Valley. These top 5 cities accounted for about 74% of the total profit of this company, considering the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n",
    "* When comparing the number of travels per company per city, it was observed that the Yellow Cab company presented a higher number of travels in nearly all cities, with exception to 4 out of 19 cities, which include Nashville TN, Pittsburgh PA, Sacramento CA and San Diego CA.\n",
    "* When analysing the proportion of profitable rides, the Yellow Cab company presented even a higher number of cities that were more profitable to the Yellow Cab compared to the Pink Cab (18 out 19 cities), with exception to Tuscon AZ, where the Pink Cab was more profitable for the 3-year period.\n",
    "* A significative strong positive correlation (0.98, p-value < 0.001) was observed between the distance travelled and the cost of the ride, however the correlation between the distance travelled and the profit was not as strong (0.46, p-value < 0.001).\n",
    "* Some rides were not profitable for both companies during the 3-year period that was evaluated, and they accounted for 13.1% and 5.0% for the Pink Cab and Yellow Cab companies.\n",
    "* The Yellow Cab company presented a higher profit per distance travelled (USD 7.11/Km) compared to the Pink Cab company (USD 2.77/Km) (p-value < 0.001).\n",
    "* Most of trips happened during the weekends (considering Friday, Saturday and Sunday) compared to the weekdays. The mean profit per ride for the weekends was USD 148.73 compared to USD 116.87 for the weekdays (p-value < 0.001).\n",
    "* The last months of the year presented higher number of rides compared to the first months of the year, especially from September to December. The Yellow Cab provided over 25,000 rides in all these months reaching a top of more than 35,000 rides in December. With a similar pattern, the Pink Cab had a lower number of rides, but the top month were also from September to December, reaching a maximum of about 11,500 rides in December too.\n",
    "* For the higher profit per month, the Pink Cab company presente a similar pattern, showing higher profits from September to December. However, for the Yellow Cab, although the months of May and June presented a much lower number of rides compared to September and October, the profit made in May and June were very close to the profit made in September and October.\n",
    "* When comparing the yearly profits, both companies presented an increase in the total profit between the years 2016 and 2017, however, there was a significant decrease in the following year (2018) compared to the previous years (p-value < 0.001) for both companies.\n",
    "* 11,442 (approximately 25%) customers out of 46,148 had only 1 ride, whereas 34,706 customers had more than a ride.\n",
    "* From 34,706 customers that had at least 2 rides, 26,078 used both services (approximately 75%), whereas the remaining 8,628 customers were loyal to one or another company.\n",
    "* The mean profit per customer for the Yellow Cab company (USD 129.37) was higher compared to the Pink Cab (USD 58.51) for the years assessed (p-value < 0.001).\n",
    "* There is no significant difference in the mean income for users of Yellow Cab and Pink Cab companies.\n",
    "* It is interesting to note that non-holidays generated higher profits compared to national holidays.\n",
    "* When weekdays were compared to weekends, highest mean profit per ride was observed during weekends (USD 148.73) compared to weekdays (USD 116.87). Be aware that weekends were considered Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n",
    "* The mean profit per Km was significantly lower year by year from 2016 to 2018 for the Pink Cab company, whereas the mean profit per Km for the Yellow Cab was significantly lower only in the year 2018 compared to the two previous years.\n",
    "* There was observed a positive strong correlation (0.94) between the number of customers that uses the service per day and the daily profit (p-value < 0.001).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most of rides were provided by the Yellow Cab company, which has a higher number of customers as well.\n",
    "* The profit by Km and profit per customer were higher for the Yellow Cab company in the past years (2016 2017, 2018).\n",
    "* Investing in the Yellow Cab company is recommended, although both companies presented a significant decrease in 2018."
